# Interrupted Bubble Sort
## Medium Difficulty

Challenge Description:
Bubble sort is the simplest algorithm for elements sorting. At each iteration we sequentially compare values of subsequent elements and swap them if necessary.

Your job is to write a program which finds a state of a given list of positive integer numbers after applying a given count of bubble sort iterations.
